maven-failsafe plugin -> will take those runners and run them in
paralell

If you not have it do below steps in your main, local machine:

1) Goto https://codoid.com/visgrid/ and download VisGrid 1.19
2) Unzip that zipped folder
3) Update the chromedriver that comes with VisGrid:
	1) download latest chromedriver from seleniumhq and unzip it and copy chromedriver file
	2) goto VisGrid unzipped folder > drivers > chrome > paste your chromedriver
	3) delete old one and rename yours to match the deleted one's name
4) Goto VisGrid folder and run the jar file
5) launch hub and few nodes

6) Goto line where you are invoking WebDriver.
	WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
	driver = new ChromeDriver();
		replace with:
	DesiredCapabilities caps = DesiredCapabilities.chrome();
	caps.setPlatform(Platform.ANY);
	driver = new RemoteWebDriver(
